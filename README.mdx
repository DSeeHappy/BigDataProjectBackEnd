### Final Project: Big Data
### Juan Daniel Sanchez Chavez


# Overview
This project allows a user to create a job which includes a location.
The server would obtain the weather from OpenWeatherMap API and store it in the database.
You would then be able to update the job to schedule based on the 30-day forecast of that location.

The idea would be if you are planning on creating your work schedule for the next month,
you would be able to see the weather for the next 30 days and schedule your work accordingly.

If this project were to be extended further, the objective would be to track and be notified of weather changes.
Helping the user make sure they don't schedule work when there is a major weather event, useful for outdoor jobs.
Plans would be to include test message, email notification or device notification if extended further beyond project scope.
